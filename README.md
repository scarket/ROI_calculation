# ROI Calculation Program

## Overview
This program is designed to calculate the Return on Investment (ROI) for different pricing strategies using the Monte Carlo method. It compares the cost-effectiveness of manual catalog processing to an automated software approach.

## Features
- Supports three pricing strategies: buyout, monthly, and daily.
- Implements Monte Carlo simulation to estimate ROI distribution.
- Calculates cost savings and increased costs for software vs. manual processes.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- NumPy library
- Matplotlib library (for plotting)

## Usage
1. Set the following input parameters in the script:
   - `manual_num_people`: Number of people required for manual catalog processing.
   - `manual_hours_per_catalog`: Hours required to process each catalog manually.
   - `hourly_wage`: Hourly wage for manual labor.
   - `software_num_people`: Number of people required for processing with software.
   - `software_hours_per_catalog`: Hours required to process each catalog with software.
   - `catalog_number`: Number of catalogs to be processed.
   - `software_basiccost`: Base cost of the software.
   - `monthly_increase_ratio`: Percentage increase in price for the monthly pricing strategy.
   - `daily_increase_ratio`: Percentage increase in price for the daily pricing strategy.
   - `trials`: Number of trials for the Monte Carlo simulation.

2. Run the script to perform the calculations.
3. Review the output statistics for each pricing strategy, including mean ROI, median ROI, 5th percentile, and 95th percentile.
4. Use the plotted graphs for a visual representation of ROI distribution across different pricing strategies.

## Calculation Methodology
The program calculates the cost for each pricing strategy and estimates the revenue generated by the software. The ROI is then calculated by comparing the cost savings or increase against the total software costs. Monte Carlo simulation is used to model the variability in cost savings, providing a distribution of possible ROI outcomes.

## Output
The script outputs the following:
- For each pricing strategy: mean ROI, median ROI, 5th percentile, and 95th percentile.
- Histograms of the ROI distribution for strategies with positive ROI.
